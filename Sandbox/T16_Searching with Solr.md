###Overview
In  this tutorial we will walk through how to use Apache Solr with Hadoop to index and search data stored on HDFS. It’s not meant as a general introduction to Solr.
  
After working through this tutorial you will have Solr running on your Hortonworks Sandbox. You will also have a solrconfig and a schema which you can easily adapt to your own use cases. Also you will learn how to use Hadoop MapReduce to index files.    
  
###Prerequisites
  
  
1. [Hortonworks HDP Sandbox 2.1](http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/)  
  
2. [Apache Solr 4.7.2](http://mirror.reverse.net/pub/apache/lucene/solr/4.7.2/solr-4.7.2.tgz)  
  
3. [Lucidworks Job Jar](http://www.lucidworks.com/hortonworks/)  
  
  
Remarks: I was using VMware’s Fusion to run Sandbox. If you choose Virtualbox things should look the same beside the fact your VM will not have it’s own IP address but rather Solr listening on 127.0.0.1. For convenience I added sandbox as a host to my /etc/hosts file on my Mac. Apache Solr 4.7.2 is the officially by Hortonworks supported version as I’m writing this (May 2014).   
  
###Steps

Let’s get it started: Power-up the sandbox with at least 4GB main memory.
    
```bash    
    ssh root@sandbox (Passwort: hadoop)
    ./start_ambari.sh
```
  
Open your browser and verify that all services are running. We will only need HDFS and MapReduce but “all lights green” is always good ;-) ![](http://digitalemil.de/solrblog/ambari.jpg)  
  
We start by creating a solr user and a folder where we are going to install the binaries:
    
```bash    
    adduser solr
    passwd solr
    
    mkdir /opt/solr
    chown solr /opt/solr
```
  
Now copy the binaries you downloaded from the list of ingredients above from your host to the Sandbox from your Mac / Windows host:

```bash
    cd ~/Downloads
    scp solr-4.7.2.tar lucidworks-hadoop-1.2.0-0-0.tar solr@sandbox:/opt/solr
```

Next step is creating dummy data we will later on index in Solr and make searchable. As mentioned above this is “Hello World!” so better do not expect big data. The file we are going to index will be four line csv file. Type the following on your Sandbox command prompt:
    
    
```bash
    echo id,text >/tmp/mydata.csv; echo 1,Hello>>/tmp/mydata.csv; echo 2,HDP >>/tmp/mydata.csv; echo 3,and >>/tmp/mydata.csv; echo 4,Solr >>/tmp/mydata.csv
```
  
Then we need to prepare HDFS:
    
```bash   
    su - hdfs
    hadoop fs -mkdir -p /user/solr/data/csv 
    hadoop fs -chown solr /user/solr
    hadoop fs -put /tmp/mydata.csv /user/solr/data/csv
```
  
  
Now it’s getting more interesting as we are about to install Solr:
    
```bash    
    su - solr
    cd /opt/solr
    
    tar xzvf solr-4.7.2.tar 
    // untar is all we need to install Solr! We still need to integrate it into HDP though. 
    tar xvf lucidworks-hadoop-1.2.0-0-0.tar
    ln -s solr-4.7.2 solr
    ln -s lucidworks-hadoop-1.2.0-0-0 jobjar
```
  
Solr comes with a nice example which we will use as a starting point:
    
```bash    
    cd solr
    cp -r example hdp 
    // Remove unnecessary files:
    rm -fr hdp/examle* hdp/multicore
    // Our core (basically the index) will be called hdp1 instead of collection1
    mv hdp/solr/collection1 hdp/solr/hdp1
    // Remove the existing core
    rm hdp/solr/hdp1/core.properties
```
Now comes the most difficult part: Making Solr storing its data on HDFS and creating a schema for our “Hello World” csv file. We need to modify two files solrconfig.xml and schema.xml
    
```bash    
    vi hdp/solr/hdp1/conf/solrconfig.xml
```
  
Search for the tag
    
```xml    
    <directoryFactory
    ..
    </directoryFactory>
```    

And completely replace it with (Make sure you copy the full line. The lines may appeart truncated in the browser but when you copy/paste the full lines you’re good):
    
```xml    
    <directoryFactory name="DirectoryFactory" class="solr.HdfsDirectoryFactory">
      <str name="solr.hdfs.home">hdfs://sandbox:8020/user/solr</str>
      <bool name="solr.hdfs.blockcache.enabled">true</bool>
      <int name="solr.hdfs.blockcache.slab.count">1</int>
      <bool name="solr.hdfs.blockcache.direct.memory.allocation">true</bool>
      <int name="solr.hdfs.blockcache.blocksperbank">16384</int>
      <bool name="solr.hdfs.blockcache.read.enabled">true</bool>
      <bool name="solr.hdfs.blockcache.write.enabled">true</bool>
      <bool name="solr.hdfs.nrtcachingdirectory.enable">true</bool>
      <int name="solr.hdfs.nrtcachingdirectory.maxmergesizemb">16</int>
      <int name="solr.hdfs.nrtcachingdirectory.maxcachedmb">192</int>
    </directoryFactory>
```    

  
Now still in solrconfig.xml look for lockType. Change it to hdfs:
    
```xml    
    <lockType>hdfs</lockType>
```    

  
Save the file and open schema.xml
    
```bash    
    vi hdp/solr/hdp1/conf/schema.xml
```
In the
    
    <fields>

tag keep only the fields with the following names:
    
    
    _version_
    _root_

Leave the dynamic fields unchanged (they could be useful for your own use-cases but we will not need them in this example though).   
Add the following fields:
    
```xml     
    <field name="id" type="string" indexed="true" stored="true" required="true" multiValued="false" />
    <field name="text" multiValued="true" stored="true"  type="text_en" indexed="true"/>
    <field name="data_source" stored="false" type="text_en" indexed="true"/> 
```    

The data_source field is required by the map reduce based indexing we will use later. The fields named id and name are matching the two columns in our csv file.   
Next remove all copyField tags and add:
Lets Add the id to text so we can search both

    <copyField dest="text" source="id"/>

  
Now we need to create our core/index. Start solr and point your browser to it (http://sandbox:8983/solr):
    
```bash    
    cd hdp
    java -jar start.jar
```

![](http://digitalemil.de/solrblog/solr1.jpg)  
Click on “Core Admin” and fill in the fields as below:  
![](http://digitalemil.de/solrblog/solr2.jpg)  
If everything goes as expected you should see the following:  
![](http://digitalemil.de/solrblog/solr3.jpg)  
If something is broken (xml file non parseable, wrong folder…) you can easily start from fresh by:
    
```bash     
    // stop or kill solr
    rm /opt/solr/solr/hdp/solr/hdp1/core.properties
    hadoop fs -rm -r /user/solr/hdp1
    // start solr again
```
  
Now choose the just created core “hdp1” from the dropdown box on the left:  
![](http://digitalemil.de/solrblog/solr4.jpg)  
  
Click on Query and press the blue “Execute Query” button. You will see that we still have 0 documents in our index which is no surprise as we have not indexed anything: ![](http://digitalemil.de/solrblog/solr5.jpg)  
  
So now we are going to index our big csv file ;-)
    
```bash    
    hadoop jar jobjar/hadoop/hadoop-lws-job-1.2.0-0-0.jar com.lucidworks.hadoop.ingest.IngestJob -Dlww.commit.on.close=true -DcsvFieldMapping=0=id,1=text -cls com.lucidworks.hadoop.ingest.CSVIngestMapper -c hdp1 -i /user/solr/data/csv/mydata.csv -of com.lucidworks.hadoop.io.LWMapRedOutputFormat -s http://localhost:8983/solr
```
  
If everything went well your output should look like:
    
```bash

Go back to your browser and enter “HDP” in the field called “q” and press “Execute Query”:

Congratulations!!!  
 
You installed and integrated Solr on HDP. Indexed a csv file through map reduce and successfully executed a Solr query against the index!   

Next steps are now installing Solr in SolrCloud mode on an HDP cluster, index real files and create a nice web app so that business users can easily search for information stored on Hadoop.   
I hope this was useful and you had fun!
